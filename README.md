# Leetcode Solutions In Python
- This project is used by myself for learning to solve [Leetcode questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) with Python 3. 

- Also, I want to be familiar with writing with [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

- It is started at Aug. 12, 2019, the day I decided to start with coding seriously.
